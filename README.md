# Spelling-Bee
I couldn't find any worthy spelling bee apps to compete with my girlfriend to prove I'm definitely the better speller, so here I am.

You can play this Spelling Bee live at http://www.aaronfox.me/spelling_bee (a refresh of the page may be required since Heroku can be finicky sometimes)

Any database of spelling bee words can be used, but I used the words found at http://www2.sharonherald.com/herald/nie/spellb/spelllist2.html; I used a Python web scraper to extract those words.
