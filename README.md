# Spelling-Bee
I couldn't find any worthy spelling bee apps to compete with my girlfriend to prove I'm definitely the better speller, so here I am.

This codebase no longer aligns with the current version Spelling Bee found on my website, and I'm only updating that version on my personal website as of now.

You can play this Spelling Bee live at http://www.aaronfox.me/spelling_bee

Any database of spelling bee words can be used, but I used the words found at http://www2.sharonherald.com/herald/nie/spellb/spelllist2.html; I used a Python web scraper to extract those words.
